pySBD - python Sentence Boundary Disambiguation (SBD) - is a rule-based sentence boundary detection module that works out-of-the-box.

This project is a direct port of ruby gem - [Pragmatic Segmenter](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter) which provides rule-based sentence boundary detection.

## Install

**Python**

    pip install pysbd

## Usage

-   Currently pySBD supports only English language. Support for more languages will be released soon.

```python
import pysbd
text = "My name is Jonas E. Smith. Please turn to p. 55."
seg = pysbd.Segmenter(language="en", clean=False)
print(seg.segment(text))
# ['My name is Jonas E. Smith.', 'Please turn to p.Â 55.']
```

-   Use `pysbd` as a [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines) pipeline component. (recommended)</br>Please refer to example [pysbd\_as\_spacy\_component.py](https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD/blob/master/examples/pysbd_as_spacy_component.py)
- Use pysbd through [entrypoints](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading#entry-points-components)

```python
import spacy
from pysbd.utils import PySBDFactory

nlp = spacy.blank('en')

# explicitly adding component to pipeline
# (recommended - makes it more readable to tell what's going on)
nlp.add_pipe(PySBDFactory(nlp))

# or you can use it implicitly with keyword
# pysbd = nlp.create_pipe('pysbd')
# nlp.add_pipe(pysbd)

doc = nlp('My name is Jonas E. Smith. Please turn to p. 55.')
print(list(doc.sents))
# [My name is Jonas E. Smith., Please turn to p. 55.]

```

We aim to provide a realistic segmenter which can provide logical sentences even when the format and domain of the input text is unknown. In our work, we adapt the Golden Rules Set (a language specific set of sentence boundary exemplars) originally implemented as a ruby gem pragmatic segmenter which we ported to Python with additional improvements and functionality. PySBD passes 97.92{\%} of the Golden Rule Set examplars for English, an improvement of 25{\%} over the next best open source Python tool.",

This project wouldn't be possible without the great work done by [Pragmatic Segmenter](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter) team.
