                **Task**: Fully Develop and Customize Learning Materials
                **Description**: Create a comprehensive and engaging course based on the provided lesson and tailor it 
                               according to the student's learning preferences. 
                               Then, develop detailed educational flashcards that supplement the course materials. 
                               Both the course and flashcards should be fully developed and ready for use by the student.
                **Expected Output**:
                    - A detailed course in LaTex format. This should include sections, key points, and interactive elements tailored to enhance learning.
                    - A complete set of flashcards in a JSON file with 'front' and 'back', where each flashcard includes a term and a definition related to the course content.
                    - A compiled PDF of the LaTeX document.
                **Actions**:
                    - Develop the course material to be complete and ready-to-deliver â€” not just an outline but filled with detailed, educational content.
                    - Create flashcards that are directly usable for study and revision, emphasizing the key concepts of the lesson.
                    - Create the files "compiled_materials.tex" and "flashcards.json"
                    - Compile the LaTeX document into a PDF format for easy distribution and use.
                **Feedback Mechanism**:
                    - Provide the profiler with a sample of the course and flashcards to receive initial feedback on their alignment with learning preferences.

                This task involves both the creation of the course, the development of supplementary materials and compiling the LaTeX file into a PDF file with 'front' and 'back'. 
                Ensure all components are finalized and ready for student use.
